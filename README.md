# linky

A linktree-esque theme, built for static hosting and easy maintenance with [Decap CMS][decap].

## Installation

Add this line to your [Jekyll][jekyll] site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-linky"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-linky
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-linky

## Usage

Use the [links layout][ll] on any page (including the home page) to display a list of all items in the `links` collection. Any additional content within your page will be displayed after the list.

The `links` collection is defined by individual files in the `_links` folder. Only the YAML frontmatter of these files will be used; content is unnecessary and will be ignored.

You will need to add a `links` collection to your Jekyll config, which is as simple as adding

```yml
collections:
    - links
```

to your `_config.yml` (see this repo's [config][config] for an example).


## Configuration

### Subhead(s)

In addition to your site's title (always displayed at the top of the links page), you can define one or more "subhead" lines to display just below the title.

These are defined as a `subheads` list in `_config.yml`:

```yml
subheads:
    - "A Linktree-esque Jekyll theme, compatible with Decap CMS."
    - "Probably more I could say here."
```

### Colors

You can override the color scheme of a Links page by adding a `linky` section to your `_config.yml` (see [the example in this repo][config]) and setting one or more of these values:

```yml
linky:
    body_background: "#fa0616"
    body_foreground: "#f0f0f0"
    button_foreground: "#f16293"
    button_background: "#f16293"
    social_button_color: "#ffffff"
```

These alter the page's background and foreground, and the background and foreground of each link "button".


### Link Metadata

A link item is defined using the following fields:

```
---
link: "https://example.com/"
image: "/images/example.jpg"
title: 'My link test'
priority: 5
expires: 2024-11-11
---
```

- `link`

    This is the target of our link. Both the image and text will point to this address. It can be a full URL or a relative
    URL to another page on your site.

- `image`

    The URL of an image to prefix the link. This should be an image on your site, to be safe -- but you *can* reference an external image.
    Note that the image will be displayed at a small size (3.5em in the default styles) and cropped to a circular shape.

- `title`

    The text to display in our link entry. Shorter text will look cleaner, but there's no arbitrary limit.

- `priority`

    Links are sorted by numerical priority (*i.e.* 1 comes first), then by `title`.

- `expires`

    A date after which this link should no longer be displayed.

    Note that this will only take effect on a rebuild; there's no runtime JavaScript, etc. to disable a link that's already been deployed.


## Update Links with Decap CMS

The whole point of this exercise (as opposed to adding links by hand or using a database-backed site) was to add/update links via a CMS, but still serve static HTML for the usual speed and safety reasons.

In my case, I'm using [Decap CMS][decap] and [Netlify][netlify]. The Decap view for [linky.roub.net][linky-home] looks like this:

<picture>
    <source srcset="images/decap-home.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="images/decap-home.png" alt="Decap CMS Home Page">
</picture>

Clicking on one of those links takes me to the detail page:

<picture>
    <source srcset="images/decap-detail.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="images/decap-detail.png" alt="Decap CMS Detail Page">
</picture>

See the [admin folder][admin] for the relevant configuration, as well as the JS that allows for a custom preview styles (which just uses the site's CSS).

Most of the admin's [config.yml][admin-config] will be the same regardless of your Decap setup, but some of the integration details (authorization, etc.) will differ if you're not using the same setup that I am. See the [Decap docs][decap-netlify] for information on the drop-in setup I'm using.

Copy the admin/index.html file from this repo into your Decap admin directory if you're using the matching Netlify setup. If not, make sure you add the script tag to enable our custom preview (it will work without the tag, but it will be ugly):

```html
<script src="/assets/preview.js"></script>
```

## Quick Start Script

To help wean your friends off Linktree more quickly, there's a script in the [scripts][scripts] folder that takes a linktree URL and attemps to pull its links, with ordering and thumbnails intact, into entries in your `_links` folder.

```sh
cd scripts
bundle install
bundle exec ruby get_links.rb https://linktr.ee/the-linktree-thing-in-question
```
